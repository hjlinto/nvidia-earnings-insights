# ðŸ“Š NVIDIA Earnings Transcript Insights

An AI-powered transcript analysis tool that processes NVIDIA's quarterly earnings calls to extract management tone, Q&A sentiment, and major strategic focuses using natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs). The application is built with a frontend interface for visualizing trends across quarters and full transcript review.

## Live Demo

[Check out the deployed app on Vercel](https://nvidia-earnings-insights-eij0j59s7-hjlintos-projects.vercel.app/)

---

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis** of prepared remarks and Q&A sessions  
- **LLM-based Extraction** of top 5 quarterly strategic focuses  
- **Static Charts** to compare tone and sentiment across time  
- **Quarterly Transcript Viewer** with prepared remarks and Q&A sections
- **Frontend deployed on Vercel**, optimized for responsiveness and readability  

---

## Developer Contributions

This project was independently developed and includes:

- Custom backend script that preprocesses raw earnings transcripts into structured JSON format with:
  - Sentiment scoring using a lexicon-based model
  - LLM interaction using Ollama to extract quarterly focuses
- Frontend built in React (Next.js) to:
  - Display bar and line charts via Recharts
  - Render transcripts, sentiments, and LLM responses dynamically
  - Fetch and display all data from a local API endpoint
- Deployment via Vercel, using GitHub integration and `/frontend` project root

---

## Technologies & AI Tools Used

- **TypeScript** (Node.js for backend, Next.js for frontend)  
- **Sentiment** (`sentiment` NPM package using AFINN-based lexicon model)  
- **Ollama** (local LLM hosting, using `llama3` model)  
- **Recharts** (charting library for visualizations)  
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling and dark mode support)  
- **Vercel** (cloud deployment)  
- **Manual JSON transcript preprocessing** from public sources  

---

## Assumptions & Limitations

- A scraper is included as part of the application; however, it was not used for this deployment due to time constraints in identifying a reliable source that allows scraping of full, transcribed earnings calls for NVIDIA
- The LLM (LLaMA3 via Ollama) provided high-quality strategic focal points, but lacked the formatting precision of advanced paid APIs, making it difficult to enforce a clean, uniform JSON schema for frontend display
- LLM output may vary slightly per run due to generative variability  
- Backend is not cloud-hosted â€” all JSON files are pre-generated and read statically

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hjlinto/nvidia-earnings-insights.git
```
2. Run the backend script to generate analysis files
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npx ts-node scripts/analyzeScripts.ts
```
3. Start the frontend development server
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
4. Open browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000/

## Reflections

- In a future version, Iâ€™d consider hosting the backend as a cloud microservice (e.g., Render or Railway) to allow dynamic, on-demand analysis and expansion to other companies or transcript sources.
- A more advanced LLM with structured output support (like OpenAIâ€™s function calling or Anthropicâ€™s JSON mode) could improve frontend integration.
